# Itenotes

This project is a web application built using a combination of **Python** for the backend and **JavaScript with React** for the frontend.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the backend.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for creating the backend API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for interacting with the database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, disk-based database for data storage.

### Frontend
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for the frontend.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating frontend components.
- **Chakra UI**: A modular and accessible component library for React, used for styling the frontend.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience, used for bundling frontend code.

### Additional Tools
- **npm**: A package manager for JavaScript, used for managing project dependencies.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages, used for the basic structure of the frontend.

## Project Structure

### Backend
- **`models.py`**: Defines the `Friend` model using SQLAlchemy, representing the data structure for storing friend information in the database.

### Frontend
- **`frontend/src/App.jsx`**: The main React component that sets up the application layout and integrates other components.
- **`frontend/src/main.jsx`**: The entry point for the React application, rendering the `App` component within a `ChakraProvider`.
- **`frontend/index.html`**: The HTML file that serves as the template for the React application.

## Overview

This full-stack web application combines a Python-based backend and a React-based frontend to provide a modern and efficient development workflow. 
- The backend handles API endpoints and database interactions.
- The frontend provides a user-friendly interface styled with Chakra UI.

The project is designed to be modular, efficient, and easy to develop further.
